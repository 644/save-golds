# save-golds
The idea is to generate a segmented speedrun of your gold splits; achieving near TAS level runs for any speedgame (as long as you're good). It saves the best time per segment in the filename so no need to delete your current golds.

Currently in Alpha. Will be ported to C#, but the python prototype works fairly well. You will need to trim videos down a bit manually. Usually only a couple of seconds at most.
